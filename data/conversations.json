Instead of storing just the current state of the data in a domain, event sourcing stores all events that led to the current state.\n\n**Core Concepts:**\n\n1. **Event Store**: A persistent storage mechanism that stores all events in chronological order. Events are immutable once stored.\n\n2. **Event Streams**: Logical groupings of events, typically organized by aggregate root or entity.\n\n3. **Snapshots**: Periodic captures of aggregate state to optimize replay performance for long event streams.\n\n**Implementation Example - E-commerce Order:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eventType\": \"OrderCreated\",\n  \"aggregateId\": \"order-12345\",\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"customerId\": \"cust-789\",\n    \"items\": [{\"productId\": \"prod-456\", \"quantity\": 2, \"price\": 29.99}],\n    \"totalAmount\": 59.98\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Complete audit trail\n- Temporal queries (state at any point in time)\n- Natural fit for event-driven architectures\n- Debugging and analytics capabilities\n\n[END RETRIEVED INFORMATION]",

We need automated data quality monitoring and correction.\n\n4. **Data Governance**: Different data sources have varying retention policies, access controls, and privacy requirements. Some data can only be accessed from specific geographic regions.\n\nFor the data lake architecture, I'm torn between:\n- **Apache Iceberg** with Spark for analytics\n- **Delta Lake** for its ACID properties\n- **Apache Hudi** for its upsert capabilities\n\nWhich would you recommend for our use case?
